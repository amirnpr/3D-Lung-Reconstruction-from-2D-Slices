**Description**
This project aims to convert 2D slices of lung images into a 3D model. By leveraging advanced image processing techniques and 3D reconstruction algorithms, this tool provides a comprehensive visualization of lung structures from sequential 2D slices, typically obtained from CT scans. The resulting 3D model can be used for enhanced diagnostic and educational purposes.
